        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My professional background lies in photography, videography, and education. After spending three years teaching Video Production at the high school level full-time, alongside some freelance content creation part-time, I decided to make a change. I packed my bags and moved to Sydney, Australia, not knowing what would come next.</p>
        <p>Moving across the world has forced me to grow and challenge myself in ways that my complacency at home wouldn't allow. As a means of committing myself to developing as both a person and a professional, I'm taking every opportunity I can to discover new passions and equip new skillsets - starting with web development. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I hope to become proficient in a multitude of frameworks and languages, starting with:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>React</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I want to continue to use technology to inspire students and hope to use my knowledge of web development as a means of doing so.</p>
